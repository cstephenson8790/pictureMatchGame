# Spot the Difference Game with JQuery

**DESCRIPTION**<br />
Users identify the differences between two photos by clicking on them.  The spots are highlighted when clicked.  When all the spots have been clicked, an email form appears so that eligible users can enter a "photo hunt" contest.

**HOW IT WORKS**<br />
A transparent, clickable overlay is absolutely positioned over the "different" image on the right.  It's an image map with a different area for each difference.  The JQuery highlights each area as it's clicked, and then shows the email form when all the areas have been clicked.
